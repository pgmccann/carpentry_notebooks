    "The program starts by importing the RSQLite library. If we were connecting to MySQL, DB2, or some other database, we would import a different library, but all of them provide the same functions, so that the rest of our program does not have to change (at least, not much) if we switch from one database to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 2 establishes a connection to the database. Since we’re using SQLite, all we need to specify is the name of the database file. Other systems may require us to provide a username and password as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "On line 3, we retrieve the results from an SQL query. It’s our job to make sure that SQL is properly formatted; if it isn’t, or if something goes wrong when it is being executed, the database will report an error. This result is a dataframe with one row for each entry and one column for each column in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last line closes our connection, since the database can only keep a limited number of these open at one time. Since establishing a connection takes time, though, we shouldn’t open a connection, do one operation, then close the connection, only to reopen it a few microseconds later to do another operation. Instead, it’s normal to create one connection that stays open for the lifetime of the program.\n",

We can do this by using a [prepared statement](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/11-prog-R/reference.html#prepared-statement) instead of formatting our statements as strings. Here’s what our example program looks like if we do this:"

Instead of formatting the query ourselves, we put question marks in the query template where we want to insert values. When we call `dbGetPreparedQuery`, we provide a dataframe that contains as many values as there are question marks in the query.
